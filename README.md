# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project is an end-to-end machine learning solution for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using the popular Kaggle dataset. It is designed to showcase practical data science and ML skills.

## üöÄ Features
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Handling class imbalance with SMOTE
- Model training and evaluation (Logistic Regression, XGBoost)
- ROC curve, confusion matrix, and feature importance plots
- Streamlit dashboard for interactive predictions

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Streamlit
- Jupyter (optional for notebooks)
